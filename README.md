# Revenue_Data_Exploration
Atliq Grand, a five-star hotel, faced a market share loss. To address this, I created an end-to-end Power BI dashboard. This tool tracked revenue by category, key metric trends, property performance, realization percentage, and other KPIs. As a result, the Revenue team increased their revenue and market share by 20% within a month.
